## game-guess
```
Write a program that makes a random number from 0 to 15 inclusive and asks the user to guess from three attempts.
Each time a user enters a number, the program responds “warmly” if the entered number differs from the number entered by 2 or less, “cold” if it is 3 or more. In each answer, the program also prompts more or less the entered number than the hidden one (displays "need more" or "need less").
If the number is guessed exactly in 3 attempts, the program ends and congratulates the user on the victory. If not, displays which number was found.
```
